# Automated-Birthday-Wisher
This project helps you to wish automatically in case you forgot to wish someone.
The project is an automated email sender that sends a personalized birthday message to a person on their birthday. 
The system is designed to scan a database of contacts and check for upcoming birthdays. 
When a birthday is identified, the system retrieves the contact's email address and sends a pre-written birthday message to their inbox. 
The message can be customized to include the person's name and any other personalized information. 
The system can be set up to send the message automatically on the day of the person's birthday or a few days before. 
This project can be useful for individuals or businesses who want to send birthday wishes to their friends, family, or customers in a timely and personalized manner without having to remember each birthday manually.
